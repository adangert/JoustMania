What is JoustMania????
--------------------------------------

* JoustMania is a collection of PlayStation Move enabled party games based off of the "Jostling" mechanic introduced in [Johann Sebastian Joust](http://www.jsjoust.com/)
* JoustMania includes FFA, Teams, Werewolves, Zombies, Commander modes, and lots of other goodies!
* The system is also designed to be easy to set up at conventions and is made to run itself with a large group of people. In convention mode, every game is started once everyone is ready, and announces the rules aloud for new players to learn.

Cool Stuffs!
--------------------------------------

* Now on [Windows & Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1093850/JoustMania/)
* 18+ Player support
* Super easy setup
* Runs in Headless mode, no screen required
* Audio is output directly through the headphone jack, no audio device/usb plugin is necessary.
* Optional web interface, view status and change game settings with your phone
* Custom music support, play with your own music
* Convention mode, no manual instructions needed, the game plays itself and switches between game modes

Hardware
---------------------------
I am currently selling fully set up Joustmania devices (pi5 - 4gb model, case, two bluetooth dongles, sd card, power supply, audio-connector, HDMI cables) for $190 with included shipping domestically. If you would like to inquire about purchasing a fully setup Joustmania device, please reach out to joustmaniagame@gmail.com.

If you would like to build your own device you will need the following:

* A Rasberry Pi 5 with sd card and a [USB audio adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-External-Converter-Compatible-Desktops/dp/B099FLWJD3/) (This option is officially supported)
* or a Rasperry pi 4 (tested however ymmv) 

Optional and recommended:

* Class 1, Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapters
* Note: we strongly recommend to use this linked TRENDnet brand as it has been tested, other dongles may or may not work/have other issues: https://a.co/d/6GG35Um

Note on Hardware: The internal bluetooth is shorter range and has a slightly higher latency
The class 1 adapters allow bluetooth connections up to 300+ feet and allow for the gameplay to be smooth, each adapter can connect to 6 to 7 controllers. I've tested this build with four adapters and 18 controllers successfully.

Optional:

* USB hub for charging controllers: [SABRENT 13 Port](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HL7Z46K) [SIIG 10 Port](http://a.co/7T3HDmJ)

This will allow you to charge 9 controllers at once through the pi


Installation
---------------------------

0. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [Install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) Raspbian on the micro SD card, this build was tested on the pi 4 and 5, with the latest version of the raspberry pi OS, 32 or 64 bit. If you would like to try installing on [Debian](https://raspi.debian.net/) there are some extra [instructions here](https://github.com/adangert/JoustMania/wiki/Debian-Instructions) that could help.
0. Connect the bluetooth adapters, (usb audio connector for the pi 5), and speakers
0. Turn on the pi, open a Terminal and run these commands, the pi will reboot on a successful install
0. If something goes wrong during installation, try running setup.sh again.

```
git clone https://github.com/adangert/JoustMania.git
cd JoustMania
sudo ./setup.sh --disable_internal_bt
```
If you would not like to turn off the internal bluetooth (this is not recommended) leave off --disable_internal_bt

You can now disconnect the hdmi cable and run JoustMania in headless mode. JoustMania will automatically boot up on restart, menu music should start playing once the pi boots up. Note audio will only play out of HDMI when plugged into a monitor, and only out of the audio jack when unpluged from a monitor.

Update Joust Mania
---------------------------
Joustmania will auto update when started and connected to the internet. Sometimes there is a large update, it will say so, then you can press the start and select buttons on a controller to start this update, wait until the pi reboots. If you have the AP enabled, you may need to disable it first to gain access to the internet.

Pairing controllers
---------------------------

* In order to pair controllers permanently, plug them into the Raspberry Pi via USB
* Once plugged in, the controller should turn white indicating that it has been paired correctly
* Press the PlayStation sync button (the circular one in the middle) to wirelessly connect paired controllers to the Pi

If pairing is not working for some reason, or you would like to resync all controllers run the following
```
cd JoustMania
sudo ./reset_bluetooth_connections.sh
```

If controllers seem to pair to only one Bluetooth adapter, it is likely that they share the same Mac address, refer to this issue: https://github.com/adangert/JoustMania/issues/172

With some bluetooth adapters and ps4 controllers, pushing the playstation sync button after plugging it into the pi may be necessary for it to pair correctly.

How to select a game mode
---------------------------------
* In order to change between games, on any controller press the select button (located on the left side of a controller)
* In order to remove a controller from play, hold the playstation button to turn off the controller.

How to start a game
---------------------------------
* When a player presses the trigger button their controller will turn white
* Once all controllers are white the game will begin!

Admin Mode: Joustmania settings
---------------------------------
You can become an Admin by pressing all four front buttons on any controller, this will allow you to modify the games settings from the four front buttons on the controller, After a game is played the Admin mode will be reset

* (Cross) Add or remove a game from Convention mode, your controller will be green if the game is added and Red if it is not, Custom Teams mode can not be added to the Convention mode
* (Circle) Change sensitivity of the game. There are three settings, slow, medium, and fast, you will hear a corresponding sound for each
* (Square) toggle the playback of instructions for each game
* (Triangle) show battery level on all controllers (full charge is Green, 80% is Turquoise, 60% is Blue, 40% is Yellow, under 40% is Red)
* The middle button can also be used to rotate through different options, then the start and select buttons can be used to increase and decrease that amount, currently this will allow you to change the amount of teams for random team mode, and whether force start works with every controller or only players who pushed the trigger button.
* Holding down the trigger button for two seconds in admin mode will force start the game.

For further settings such as turning off audio (play_audio) or changing the colors of controllers please edit the joustsettings.yaml file in the Joustmania folder.

Web Interface
---------------------------------
Joustmania can also be controlled via a web browser on your laptop or smartphone. If your Pi is on a network, use the IP address of your Pi (for example, http://192.168.1.xxx/). Alternatively, you can turn your Pi in to an access point and connect your device directly to it. To enable this,  run the command
```
sudo ./enable_ap.sh
```
Note that this disables normal Wi-Fi on the Pi, the ethernet connection should still work however. The default SSID is "JoustMania" and the default password is "joustpass";

To connect to the game, go to http://joust.mania in your web browser, you may have to disable LTE on mobile. To disable the access point and restore Wi-Fi, run the command
```
sudo ./disable_ap.sh
```


Custom Music
---------------------------------
* JoustMania comes with a couple of pre-installed default songs.
* Play your own music, by copying it into the respective folders: /audio/(Joust, Zombie, Commander)/music/
* Supports Mp3, Wav, Ogg, flac and others [Here](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats), 
* All music and audio can be disabled by changing `play_audio = False` in joustsettings.yaml, this will also disable tempo sensitivity changes for each game mode
* two different menu voices can be selected, either aaron or ivy, you can change this via the menu_voice setting in joustsettings.yaml
